# Work-Day-Scheduler

## Description

This project was my first attempt at using day js. While this project was challenging, it seemed more doable than the two previous ones. I struggled the most with getting the info to render back to the screen from local storage. This code provides the user with a work day scheduler that changes colors showing the time (past, present, and future) and gives a space for the user to write their tasks for the day.
